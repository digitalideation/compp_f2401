## Content

- Sharing and inspiration
- Step back, Keras & Pytorch: What is it?
  - Intro to tools: [Keras](https://keras.io/)
  - [First steps with Keras](https://github.com/digitalideation/compp_f2401/tree/master/samples/keras_pytorch)
    - First Look
    - Classifying movie reviews
    - Shape classifier
  - Intro to tools: [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
  - [First steps with Pytorch](https://github.com/digitalideation/compp_f2401/tree/master/samples/keras_pytorch)
    - Using pretrained models
    - All as tensors
    - Turn real-world data into tensors
- [ImageGen: What the #@ˆ% are we doing?](../slides/week03.pdf)

## Goal

The goal this week is to:

1. Understand what ML models are built with
2. Understand how ImageGeneration models are working
3. Getting more familiar with tools

## Preparation work

Try to work with Keras, explore ImageGen tools
